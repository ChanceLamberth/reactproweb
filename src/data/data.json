  "About": {
    "paragraph1": "My name is Chance and I am currently in my 2nd year of my Computer Science Master Program at Northeastern University. My expected graduation is December 2022. I currently hold a B.S. in Economics and a minor in History also from Northeastern. Why the big switch? I was working for a large asset manager in Boston, MA and recognized the significant impact software had in finance and other industries. I decided then and there that I wanted to be at the forefront of innovative software.",
    "paragraph2": "I discovered Northeastern provides a bridge to Master program called Align with the belief that computer and data science is for everyone, regardless of background. I stand with that belief. The program is structured with bridge courses that prepare students of any undergraduate discipline for graduate level coursework in Computer Science. Align has changed the way I view the world and set me on a path that is for me.",
    "paragraph3": "My life was a revolving door of sports growing up. I started playing baseball when I was four. Then in middle school, I tacked on running. Track & Field and Cross Country eventually became my new outlet and earned me a scholarship to run at the Division 1 level. I stopped running in March 2020 when the Pandemic hit and cut my collegiate season short. It was a good run, no pun intended, and I posted some strong times. The highlight of my running career was running one mile in 4:09, an 8k in under 24 minutes, and a multitude of opportunities to compete across the United States. Now, I am an avid cyclist hoping to challenge myself in a new way."
